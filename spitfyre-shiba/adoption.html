    <p>If you are ready to purchase a puppy or put down a deposit than <strong>read this entire page</strong> and then
        follow these steps</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Read the <a href="downloads/purchase.pdf" target="_blank">Lifetime Health Guarantee Contract</a> and if you
            are having your puppy shipped,
            review our Shipping Page prior to putting down a deposit.
        </li>
        <li>Ask any questions you may have.</li>
        <li>Fill out our <a href="downloads/application.pdf" target="_blank">Puppy Application</a> (We will get back to
            you within 24 hours).
        </li>
        <li>If you are approved, you can submit a deposit with <a href="downloads/contract.pdf" target="_blank">this
            contract</a></li>
        <li>Fill out, sign and return <a href="downloads/purchase.pdf" target="_blank">The Lifetime Health Guarantee
            Contract</a></li>
        <li>We will e-mail you the Puppy Manual and be sure to read the Puppy Manual to get ready for your new family
            member!! There is a lot of important information in this manual. Please make sure to read it.
        </li>
        <li>Call or <a href="mailto:scout@eot.com">email</a> to set up a day and time to come see the pups and pick out
            the one you want.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Pick up days are on Saturdays. Contact us if you need to do another day (extra fees will apply due to having to
        rearrange the dogs/kids routines).<br><br>
        We do occasionally meet if requested. We are located in Akeley, Minnesota.<br><br>
        If you are having your puppy shipped, we will take care of all shipping arrangements and will do so 1 week prior
        to puppy's ready to go date. All contracts and payments must be received by this point.<br><br>
        Unless prior arrangement is made any pups left here after 8 weeks will be an additional $100 per week for
        boarding,
        grooming, training, vaccinations, worming etc. and is Non-Refundable. This does not apply to those purchasing
        older pups unless you elect to leave them here longer.
        This is for those who want to leave the pup here for longer due to vacation, work schedule etc. to cover
        additional shots, food, care and training.</p>
    <h3>Deposits and Payments:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>We require a non-refundable deposit of Four Hundred Dollars to hold any puppy (Can be transferred to a
            different available puppy).
            However, if you do so after having a deposit down on a puppy for more than 2 weeks $200 will be deducted
            from the deposit.
        </li>
        <li>The $400 deposit will be deducted from the final purchase price.</li>
        <li>$400 of the purchase price is considered a deposit regardless if you pay a deposit or pay in full.</li>
        <li>Puppies are chosen in the order we receive the deposits.</li>
        <li>There is an extra 4% fee if you pay via credit card (Square, PayPal) that means if you are paying a deposit of $400
            then add $16 for the fee's so total would be $416. If you do not add it it will be added to your balance due.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If your puppy application is approved, we will e-mail you the deposit contract, print, and return this contract with
    your deposit, your deposit will not be applied to puppy/VIP list until it is received.<br><br>
        We do not hold puppies without a deposit.</p>
    <h3>Please use one of the following Payment Options:</h3>
    <p>This is a Non-Refundable Puppy Deposit</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Credit Card or PayPal</strong> - There is an extra 4% fee for either of these</li>
        <li><strong>Cash</strong> (at pickup is fine, but not for a deposit)</li>
        <li><strong>Walmart MoneyGram</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Direct Bank Transfer</strong> (Full Payments Only)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not accept Cashierâ€™s Checks or Money Orders of any kind.</p>
    <p>Due to Minnesota State Law, if you pick your puppy up in the state of Minnesota, we must charge sales tax of 7.35%. That will be added to the price of your puppy.</p>
    <p>I retain the right to terminate any adoption at any time for any reason until puppy is delivered
        (of course deposit is refunded, if I should terminate).</p>
