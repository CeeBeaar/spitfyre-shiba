    <button class="accordion">Are the puppies registered?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>All Parents are AKC registered and all litters are registered with the AKC.<br>
            Pets will come with limited AKC registration and Breeding/show prospects will come with Full AKC registration.

    <button class="accordion">What age do puppies go to their new homes?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>8 weeks of age, Puppies we decide to keep for a while to further evaluate for show/breeding may become available later.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Have the puppies received any vaccinations?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>The puppies are vaccinated and wormed three times before they go to their new homes. We provide a health record and a recommended shot schedule for future vaccinations,
            worming, neutering/spaying. All puppies receive the following vaccinations at the following ages. Just look at the age of the puppy your interested in and you will see
            what they have had for vaccinations.<br>
            <strong>5 weeks:</strong> Nobivac DPv Strongid-T De-worming<br>
            <strong>7 weeks:</strong> Nobivac Canine 1-DAPPv Panacure De-worming<br>
            <strong>9 weeks:</strong> Nobivac Canine 1-DAPPv- Strongid-T De-worming<br>
            <strong>12 weeks:</strong> Nobivac Canine 1-DAPPv- Panacure De-worming<br><br>
            <strong>What is DAPPv? -</strong> Canine Infectious Distemper, Hepatitis, Adenovirus, Parainfluenza, Parvovirus
        </p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">Can I look at puppies before 7 weeks of age?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>NO, Doing just that is one of the primary methods disease is spread from one litter to another. You can carry it on your hands,
            shoes or clothes. This may sound extreme, but I always ask people to take a shower and wear clean clothes and shoes when they come to my house.
            However I do keep updated pics (and occasionally video) on the website.</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">Will you accept a deposit for "first choice" in a litter?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Yes, I take deposits down for the 1st and 2nd choice of males and females (after us of course). If what you requested isn't in the litter,
            you can wait for the next litter, or you may have first choice of the available puppies.</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">Do you keep a "waiting list"?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>I receive dozens of inquiries on a weekly basis. It's very difficult to determine who's serious and who's just looking for information from a variety of breeders.
            Because of this, I will only contact those who are on our VIP list and submitted deposits.</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">Would you take back a dog if I could no longer keep the dog for whatever reason?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>OF COURSE!!! One of the items on our sales contract is regarding returns and you must notify us first. Any puppy produced by us is always welcome to come back.
            We have had some puppies come back due to family crisis, illnesses, unplanned events etc. We keep them until we can place them in new homes. We love our puppies
            and have the belief that because we created them we are responsible for their well being the entirety of their life.</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">What defects are your puppies examined for?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>All of our puppies are checked for conformation defects at birth and when leaving for their new home. If any are
            found they are noted on sales contract. The majority of hereditary diseases are not detectable when a puppy is under
            1 year of age. We do offer a lifetime health guarantee against hereditary and congenital diseases and defects.</p>
