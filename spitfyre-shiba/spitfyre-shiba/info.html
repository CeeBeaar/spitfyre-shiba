    <h2>An Introduction to the Shiba Inu</h2>
    <p>Shiba have a "fox like" appearance that is captivating. They are unusually hardy and robust little dogs that do not
        require the pampering and grooming that so many breeds require. They are the smallest of all the Japanese breeds,
        with a very compact, muscular body.  This gives them great agility and an attitude of gracefulness and elegance.
        They are a very friendly dog, lively while also being very attentive to their owners feelings. They can be an excellent
        guard dogs, yet are not a yappy breed.  They make an excellent family pets and wonderful playmate for children.
        The loyalty of the breed to their masters and family is a much repeated statement that we have heard from the people who have owned them.</p>

    <h2>A Brief History of the Shiba Inu</h2>
    <p>Originally, Shiba were bred to flush birds and small game and were occasionally used to hunt wild boar. Now they are primarily kept as pets,
        both in Japan and the United States. There are more Shiba in Japan than any other breed. Around 7000 BC the ancestors of today's
        Shiba may have accompanied the earliest immigrants to Japan. Archaeological excavations of the shell-mounds left by the Jomonjin,
        or Rope-Pattern People (a name derived from the pattern found on their earthenware), show that they had small dogs in the 14 1/2 to
        19 1/2 inch range. In the third century BC, a new group of immigrants brought their dogs to Japan. These dogs then interbred with the
        descendants of the Jomonjin dogs, and produced canines known to have pointed, erect ears and curly or sickle tails.</p>
